# PySide6-Hearts-Game
Thanks for looking at my Hearts game!
This program is a Hearts implementation that follows classic Hearts rules (there is a rules page in the program).
FEATURES:
  You can save a game using the button in the top right corner and load it back using the load button.
  If you click on the scoreboard in the top left you get an expanded scoreboard with a round-by-round breakdown as well as more menu options.
